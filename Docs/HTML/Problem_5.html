<p>This problem tracks as you edit the menu from the last practice problem to involve multiple levels, and loop repeatedly through it</p>
<p>At the main level, add another option to edit a mark. Within this option, you should be able to pick a course (Can be any course for now, irrespective of the add course option), then add, edit or remove a grade. A grade consists of both a mark, and a weight. (None of these have to be kept track of. Just print a message saying what has been done)</p>
<p>In addition, your code should match the following two criteria</p>
<ol>
<li>You must use <code>elif</code> blocks where applicable</li>
<li>You must separate the inputs from the outputs. Ask for the required inputs in one <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code> set of block, and print them in another set of <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code> blocks. This will be useful for later. Use a variable to keep track of where your program will need to go to print the output.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Syntax to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>elif {condition}:</code> Must follow an <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code> block immediately after the code inside is finished. Should be indented the same as the accompanying conditional blocks. Similar to <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code> will run the indented code below it if the condition evaluates to true. In an <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code>/<code>else</code>, once the code in the first block's with a true <code>{condition}</code> is run, the chain breaks, and jumps to the line immediately after the last <code>elif</code>/<code>else</code>.</li>
<li><code>else:</code> If none of the conditions in an <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code> chain are true, then the else block executes the code contained inside (indented)</li>
<li><code>float()</code> Similar to <code>int()</code> and <code>string()</code>. This is a datatype used to hold decimal numbers. Sometimes you will see small values at the end, like <code>3.0000000017</code> due to the way this math works on base-2 (binary) computers, versus the base-10 we use in everyday math</li>
</ul>
