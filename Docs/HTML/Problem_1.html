<p>This task tracks as you create a basic greeter for the bot. A user should be able to input their name, and have it printed out to the terminal.</p>
<hr>
<p>Syntax to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>print()</code> will 'print' a value. Note that this does not mean using an actual printer, but rather printing to the screen the text inside the brackets.</li>
<li><code>input()</code> will display contents of the text inside the brackets to the user, similar to print, but will pause the program, and return the value to user entered.
<ul>
<li>When a command returns a value, this means you can set something equal to the command. For example, <code>x=max(3,4)</code> would set <code>x</code> equal to the return value of <code>max(3,4)</code>, which is <code>4</code>, and you would be able to use x in place of a number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>+</code> will add two variables or objects. In addition to working for addition, like <code>5 + 6</code>, it also works for adding strings, <em>aka text</em>, together, by returning a string that contains the left side followed immediately by the contents on the right side. In addition to being able to add two variable like <code>a = b+c</code>, you can also add a variable and a plain string of text, like <code>a = &quot;Hello, &quot; + c</code>. One common error is that you can only add a string to a string, or a number to a number. <code>a = 5 + c</code> will throw an error if <code>c</code> contains text. To avoid this, convert your numbers to strings using <code>str(5)</code>, which returns <code>&quot;5&quot;</code> (as a string, not a number). Finally, you may also chain addition operators like <code>a = b + c + d + e</code>.</li>
</ul>
