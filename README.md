# 1405 Incremental Problem
## Building A discord bot
Collection of practice problems for COMP 1405, Starting from near basics, and ending up with a fully featured discord bot.

Sample code will be added, and right now is still largely in development. It was originally done so I could see what skills I would need to write about for each step, but it will be included in the final version. Although the names reflect file names in Docs, the Docs files are constantly being changed and added to, so sample code does not correlate with the docs as of this point in time.

These practice problems take an incremental approach, starting from near basics, and covering topics such as recursion, file I/O, APIs, and asynchronous code to varying levels of detail. While I will try to explain some of the more complicated topics myself, I will include links to documentation from reputable placeas, as a way for the student to augment their own knowledge in a more natural way. After all, there won't be a function-by-function tutorial available in their first job. 

You are free to use the code here for anything. Please however note that the modules used in this may not have as broad licensing.
