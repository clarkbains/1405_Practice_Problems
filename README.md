# 1405 Incremental Problem
## Building A discord bot
Collection of practice problems for COMP 1405, Starting from near basics, and ending up with a fully featured discord bot.


These practice problems take an incremental approach, starting from near basics, and covering topics such as recursion, file I/O, APIs, and asynchronous code to varying levels of detail. While I will try to explain some of the more complicated topics myself, I will include links to documentation from reputable places, as a way for the student to augment their own knowledge in a more natural way. After all, there won't be a function-by-function tutorial available in their first job. 

You are free to use the code here for anything. Please however note that the modules used in this may not have as broad licensing.
